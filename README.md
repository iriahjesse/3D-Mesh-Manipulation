# 3D-Mesh-Manipulation

This project created a runtime tool in Unity for manipulating 3D meshes and visualizing their structure in real time, designed to support the testing and demonstration of mesh deformation algorithms.

## Core Features
Selective Transformation: Utilizes Matrix4x4 calculations to apply precise translation, rotation, and scaling to specified vertex groups (e.g., the top half of a mesh). This enables localized, region-based mesh deformation.

Topology Visualization: Renders the edges of every triangle in real-time using multiple LineRenderer components, providing immediate visual feedback on the mesh structure.
